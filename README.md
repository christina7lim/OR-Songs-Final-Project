# OR-Songs-Final-Project
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "final_project_script.R" file, which contains the code for my research. To access the dataset, open the "Olivia Rodrigo Songs - Sheet1 (3) .csv" file.

## **Data**
The data used was all of Olivia Rodrigo's published songs from her albums, "Sour", "Guts", and her songs from the TV series, "High School Musical The Musical The Series." The question being asked what was kind of audience does she have and how do her different songs appeal to people. Each unit of analysis was one song, adding up to 35 units. The type of sampling I used was convience. 

I gathered my data by going through each song in her albums and under her name on Spotify multiple times. I also used Spotify to find the exact amount of listens.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of "Mood" considering how the song came off and made a listener feel. This was broken into Sad, Middle, and Upbeat. 

The concept of "Theme" reffered to the overall meaning of the song. This eas broken into, Spite, Heartbreak, and Growth.

The concept of "Catchiness" measured how much someone would sing along and know the lyrics. This was ranked on a scale from 1-5 with 5 being the most catchy where you could lose your voice singing it so hard, and 1 where you would not sing at all.
